# What is this?

This is a portfolio website in Winows95 style desktop, all apllications and images are almost pixel perfect equal to what you would see in real Windows95.

This is a place where I test my skills and stuff I am interested in (later this page will get bigger).

If you are interested in how this works or have some interesing ideas to add here, this project is publicly available <a href="https://github.com/dk731/portfolio-web" target="_blank">here</a>.
